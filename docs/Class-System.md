# Enigmatic Class Corelation (ECC)

### Structuring the Magic System and Classes

#### Core Concept: Enigmatica
The foundation of your world’s magic system revolves around **Enigmatica**, a fundamental particle introduced by the **Vhalkin**. This particle has the unique ability to manipulate both **matter and energy**. Enigmatica is controlled through **EnigCode**, a form of biological coding that living beings, especially Vhalkin, naturally harness. Over time, other intelligent species, like humans, learned to manipulate Enigmatica by observing and deciphering Vhalkin’s use of it.

Enigmatica usage evolves in various forms depending on the character's training, natural ability, and exposure, leading to different **classes** of users.

### Class System Hierarchy

1. **Mage**  
   - Mages manipulate Enigmatica directly through the use of **EnigCode**.
   - They evolve from relying on written **scrolls** to mastering the art of crafting spells, eventually manipulating Enigmatica at a **particle level**.

   **Subclasses**:
   - **Scroll Caster**  
     - Relies on scrolls containing pre-written EnigCode to perform magic.
     - Lowest level of proficiency, similar to beginners using tools.

   - **Innate Caster**  
     - Capable of casting spells by generating EnigCode on their own.
     - The middle tier of mastery—those who no longer need external scrolls to perform magic.
     
   - **Spell Architect** (needs name)  
     - Mages who understand the deeper mechanics of magic, able to tweak spells for more creative applications.
     - They can manipulate the behavior of existing spells, creating variations.

   - **Enigma Scribe**  
     - Masters of spell crafting. They can create new scrolls, modify complex spells, and even adapt **Vhalkin EnigCode** for human use.
     - They unlock the creation of original spells, blending multiple spells and techniques.

   - **Enigmatica Scholar**  
     - Dedicated to in-depth study of Enigmatica and EnigCode.
     - They write EnigCode from scratch and have the highest understanding of magical theory, nearing the ability to manipulate magic without predefined rules.
     
   - **Instinctive Manipulator**  
     - A rare breed of mage who manipulates Enigmatica at the particle level instinctively without writing any EnigCode.
     - They begin writing new codes based on what they feel during manipulation, operating almost entirely on intuition.

   - **Bloodline Caster**  
     - These casters have inherited magical abilities passed down through their lineage.
     - Their powers often appear instinctively and focus on a specific range of abilities based on their ancestry.

   - **Mutant Caster**  
     - Casters who have mutated abilities that give them specialized, often strange, powers. Not all mutations are beneficial, but many confer unique magical abilities.

2. **Hunter**  
   - Hunters operate with a different kind of magic system that revolves around their **Hunter Aura**. This aura evolves as they defeat magical beasts, making their bodies stronger and allowing them to perform magic through **weapons** crafted from the monsters they slay.

   **Subclasses**:
   - **Beast Slayer**  
     - Focuses on direct combat, using enhanced physical strength and weaponry made from beasts. Their magic is often weapon-centric.

   - **Beast Tamer**  
     - These hunters form bonds with magical beasts, taming them and using their abilities in combat. Their aura manipulation extends to controlling beasts.

   - **Spirit Walker**  
     - Hunters who have learned to merge their Hunter Aura with the spirit of a slain beast. They can temporarily assume the abilities or traits of the beasts they’ve conquered.

3. **Technomancer-Alchemist (Combined Class)**  
   - These individuals blend **technology** and **alchemy** with Enigmatica to create potent devices, potions, and constructs. They are masters of both the physical world and magical engineering.

   **Subclasses**:
   - **Machinist**  
     - Focuses on creating autonomous machines and tools that are infused with Enigmatica. They rely on technology to enhance their magic.

   - **Runesmith**  
     - Uses ancient runes in combination with magical technology to craft potent enchanted items.

   - **Bioengineer**  
     - Manipulates life itself, creating new creatures, enhancing organisms, or using alchemy to influence biology.

   - **Potion Master**  
     - Experts in alchemical concoctions that enhance, heal, or even change the properties of those who consume them.

4. **Warrior**  
   - Warriors use Enigmatica to enhance their physical strength and combat prowess. Their techniques are passed down from a **Primordial entity**, and they harness magic in the form of martial skills.

   **Subclasses**:
   - **Primordial Disciple**  
     - Masters of the original techniques taught by the Primordial entity, they rely on enhancing their physical form through Enigmatica.
   
   - **Bladestorm**  
     - Weapon specialists who infuse their combat techniques with Enigmatica, augmenting their strikes.

   - **Fistbreaker**  
     - Focuses on unarmed combat, using raw strength and Enigmatica to destroy their opponents.

   - **Windwalker**  
     - Warriors that master mobility and speed, using Enigmatica to perform advanced movement techniques.

   - **Voidfist**  
     - Unarmed combatants that manipulate space and gravity through their strikes.

This structure places the **core concept** of **Enigmatica** at the top, then cascades down into the four **main classes**, and finally into their specialized **subclasses**. The system becomes progressively detailed as we move deeper, from understanding how Enigmatica functions to exploring how different classes manipulate it to achieve their abilities.
