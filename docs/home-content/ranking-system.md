## 5. **Ranking System (ZERS)**

The **Zephlore Evolutionary Ranking System (ZERS)** is the most commonly used system in Vhalus to measure individual strength and survival capability. The ranking system has layers within each rank, from **Fledgling** to **Primordial**, and each layer indicates mastery over various aspects such as physical strength, EM capacity, and combat ability.

- **Ranks**:
  - *Bronze (III, II, I)*
  - *Adept (III, II, I)*
  - *Elite (III, II, I)*
  - *Obsidian (III, II, I)*
  - *Primordial (The highest and rarest rank)*

To ascend, individuals must pass tests that include both physical challenges and scenario-based simulations.
