## **Locations**

The world map of Vhalus is **procedurally generated**. As regions are created and explored, they become filled with content, lore, and points of interest. Areas in between major locations will continue to be generated to fill gaps, ensuring that the world is dynamic and constantly evolving.

- **Example Locations**:
  - *Zephyrine Mountains*: A towering range home to the descendants of the primordial Zepharion, where the air itself seems alive with magical energy.
  - *Cradle of the Earth*: A vast forest nurtured by Terreska, where the trees grow to impossible heights, and magical beasts roam freely.
  - *The Forgotten Isles*: A mysterious chain of islands filled with ancient ruins and untapped Enigmatica sources.
