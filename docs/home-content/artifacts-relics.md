## **Artifacts/Relics**

Artifacts of immense power are scattered across Vhalus, often the remains of Primordials or highly concentrated forms of Enigmatica.

- **The Eye of Zepharion**: A crystalline orb said to hold a fraction of Zepharion's power, allowing its wielder to control the winds.
- **The Earthshaker's Fist**: A gauntlet imbued with the essence of Terreska, granting the wearer the strength to move mountains.
- **The Enigmarc**: An enigmatic relic that enhances a person's ability to manipulate Enigmatica, though its full powers remain a mystery.
