## **Vhalkin and Vhalus Mutations**

The creatures of Vhalus are divided into two major categories:

- **Vhalkin**: These are magical creatures directly created by the **Primordials**. Vhalkin are often deeply connected to the natural magic of the world and play a vital role in maintaining balance.
- **Vhalus Mutations**: Over time, ordinary animals exposed to the influence of Enigmatica have evolved into powerful and dangerous creatures. These mutations occur unpredictably and create new, unique monsters that challenge the people of Vhalus.
