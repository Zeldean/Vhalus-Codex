# Welcome to Vhalus

### 1. **World Overview**
Vhalus is a world brimming with magic, ancient creatures, and evolving civilizations. Over thousands of years, the land has changed, shaped by the hands of powerful beings known as the Primordials and the forces of Enigmatica, a mysterious energy that fuels the magic of the world. As you explore, you will encounter untamed wilderness, advanced cities, and remnants of long-lost civilizations, all influenced by the natural and magical forces that permeate Vhalus.

### 2. **Magic System**
Magic in Vhalus revolves around the manipulation of **Enigmatica**, an energy source capable of influencing both matter and energy. Enigmatica Manipulation (EM) allows individuals to wield extraordinary powers, drawing from their capacity to store and control Enigmatica particles.

- **Enigmatic Particles**: These particles can exist in both matter and energy forms, making them incredibly versatile. 
- **enigCrystals**: A unique crystal that forms naturally within beings that can harness Enigmatica, acting as their core power source.
- **Magic Users**: Magic is categorized into various disciplines, with different classes (such as Mages and Technomancers) specializing in unique applications of Enigmatica.

### 3. **Vhalkin and Vhalus Mutations**
The creatures of Vhalus are divided into two major categories:
- **Vhalkin**: These are magical creatures directly created by the **Primordials**. Vhalkin are often deeply connected to the natural magic of the world and play a vital role in maintaining balance.
- **Vhalus Mutations**: Over time, ordinary animals exposed to the influence of Enigmatica have evolved into powerful and dangerous creatures. These mutations occur unpredictably and create new, unique monsters that challenge the people of Vhalus.

### 4. **Notable Vhalkin (Primordials)**
The Primordials are the ancient beings that shaped Vhalus. They are revered as god-like figures, responsible for creating the Vhalkin and influencing the spread of magic.

- **Example Primordial**:  
  - *Zepharion*: A colossal, draconic being that roams the skies, believed to be the originator of aerial magic. Its descendants, known as Sky Vhalkin, dominate the skies.
  - *Terreska*: The primordial of earth and nature, known for creating the foundation of Vhalus's ecosystems. It is said that the vast forests of Vhalus are its gift to the world.

### 5. **Ranking System (ZERS)**
The **Zephlore Evolutionary Ranking System (ZERS)** is the most commonly used system in Vhalus to measure individual strength and survival capability. The ranking system has layers within each rank, from **Fledgling** to **Primordial**, and each layer indicates mastery over various aspects such as physical strength, EM capacity, and combat ability.

- **Ranks**:  
  - *Fledgling (III, II, I)*  
  - *Adept (III, II, I)*  
  - *Elite (III, II, I)*  
  - *Obsidian (III, II, I)*  
  - *Primordial (The highest and rarest rank)*  

To ascend, individuals must pass tests that include both physical challenges and scenario-based simulations.
