## **Enigmatica System**

Enigmatica is a **massless particle** that exists within the world of Vhalus. These particles have the unique ability to influence matter and energy, allowing practitioners to manipulate their surroundings in diverse ways. The manipulation of Enigmatica is a fundamental part of life in Vhalus, shaping both its civilizations and natural environments.

### **Nature of Enigmatica**
Enigmatica particles can transform into **EnigMatter** or **EnigEnergy**, granting the ability to mould physical constructs or release energy-based effects. This process is known as **Enigmatica Manipulation (EM)**, where the practitioner gains control over the particles to achieve various outcomes. The Vhalkin, an ancient species, were the first to master this ability, passing down the knowledge of how to control Enigmatica throughout the ages.

### **The Presence of Enigmatica in the World**
Enigmatica particles began appearing in Vhalus at a specific point in its history, causing significant transformations. Both animals and plants underwent mutations to adapt to the presence of Enigmatica. Most living creatures developed **enigCrystals**, which store and regulate the particles within their bodies.

- **Fauna Mutations**: Animals experienced mutations that led to the rise of the **Vhalus Mutations**, creatures with extraordinary abilities linked to the Enigmatica particles they absorbed. These creatures inhabit various regions and play a critical role in the ecosystems of Vhalus.
- **Flora Mutations**: Plants did not form large enigCrystals like animals. Instead, they developed **microscopic enigCrystals**, distributed throughout their structures, allowing them to store and use Enigmatica in subtle but effective ways to aid in their growth and survival.

### **EnigCrystals and Their Importance**
The development of **enigCrystals** is one of the most significant mutations caused by Enigmatica. These crystals store the particles and play a critical role in how creatures and humans alike access and manipulate Enigmatica. EnigCrystals vary in size and potency, depending on the organism they originate from, and are vital for advanced forms of Enigmatica Manipulation.

### **Enigmatica Manipulation (EM)**
The art of controlling Enigmatica particles is referred to as **Enigmatica Manipulation (EM)**. Through concentration and training, practitioners are able to direct these particles to interact with their environment. EM can create physical constructs, channel energy, and moreâ€”depending on the skill and intent of the user.

The most common path to mastering EM begins with the use of **enigScrolls**, which serve as conduits for practising control over Enigmatica particles. By repeating specific techniques, practitioners gradually become proficient in EM and can eventually perform it without relying on scrolls. Over time, as they deepen their connection with Enigmatica, their abilities grow, allowing them to manipulate more complex forms of EnigMatter and EnigEnergy.

### **The Enigmatic Origin Cycle**
Every **256 years**, the world experiences a massive surge of Enigmatica particles, known as the **Enigmatic Origin Cycle**. This cycle leads to rapid and widespread mutations among both fauna and flora, resulting in the emergence of thousands of new species while causing the extinction of others. 

During this time, the influx of new species provides opportunities for further advancements in Enigmatica Manipulation and technology. People can harvest new types of enigCrystals and develop innovative **enigCode** systems, equipment, and tools. The Enigmatic Origin Cycle is a period of both great risk and immense discovery, as new species often possess untapped potential for progress.
